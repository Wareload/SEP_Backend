# SEP Backend

Backend of the group "Bugs Bunnies" for the SEP of the "Hochschule Mannheim" in the summer semester 2022.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm run start-ts
```

To run the typescript compiler run

```bash
  npm run build
```

To run the generated javascript project

```bash
  npm run start
```

For testing (jest framework) run

```bash
  npm run test
```

Alternative create a docker image and run it with docker compose.
A sample docker-compose file is [this](doc/full_docker-compose.yml).

Take care, you might not have access to the used docker registry and build an image.

To run this application there is also a mysql database needed with TLS.

This application is developed for a mysql flex database from Azure.

The required tables will be created on start.

You need to put the TLS certificate named as cert.pem in the [cert](cert) directory.

To create a docker image execute

```bash
  docker build -t {registry}/{user}/{image-name}:version-tag .
```

where registry and user are not necessary. You need to call the typescript compiler first, because there is no
multistaged build yet.

or

```bash
  npm run build-docker
```

## Api

The Api is described [here](./swagger.yml).
